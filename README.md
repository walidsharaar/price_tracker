# price_tracker
day 47 of 100 days of python - amazon web scraping 
Develop a Python bot to check for the price. When the price is low alert the user by email. The idea here is the little Python body is going to have a set time, such as 
7:00 AM every day where it checks that URL that we got.
So it's going to look at a specific thing on the webpage,
which the price is below our set target of the amount then it's should send an email and give alert.
